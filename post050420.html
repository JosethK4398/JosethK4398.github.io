	<p> First post—very exciting! Hopefully it will be the first of many. This will serve as a template for later posts. Unfortunately I have no interesting projects ready to share at the moment, so instead, I have provided a larger version of the picture appearing under the "about" section on the main page. While I am sure that this is obvious to you, I am writing it here anyway in order to have enough text-volume to fill this page to a somewhat-reasonable degree. <br><br> Since this is my first post, I thought it might be prudent to make a few general statements about what to expect from this site in the future:<br><br> 1) I suck at web design, so it won't be getting any prettier. Sorry. <br><br> 2) Most of the posts will be weaving or woodworking related, but I will certainly not limit myself to these areas—content will vary widely and some may be X-rated. <br><br> 3) I plan to add a comments section at some point so I can hear from my (presumably nonexistent) readers. However, as I mentioned, I suck at web design, so this will not happen until my lazy ass can muster the effort to learn how. <br><br> 4) I should have some real content up in the next few days, so on the off chance that my site in its current infantile state has piqued your interest, stay tuned.</p>
