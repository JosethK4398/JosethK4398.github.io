	<p>This is an old project, and pretty simple compared to what I've been working on lately, but I probably won't be making any more single-strand knots, so thought I would include this one here for the sake of thoroughness. <br><br> The basic structure is a ring of four jury mast knots—a type of sailing knot made from three crossing-turns, whose with a practical purpose that I'm sure I'd find very interesting if I were a sailor—overlapping at the side-bights, with, uh, <i>several</i> more passes through all four to fully integrate them into a relatively-seamless whole. Obviously there are more structural details to be had but I don't really remember what I did, <s>and I don't understand my own creation well enough for post-hoc figuring.</s><br><br> It was while making this knot that I first became frustrated with the limitations of single-strand weaving: while it's a design that clearly suggests some kind of radial symmetry, the single strand means it only gets one axis, giving it a distinctly inelegant quality.</p>
