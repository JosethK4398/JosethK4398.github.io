	<p>Another one from the archive—my first multi-strand—well, 2-strand—design. For many years, I exclusively designed and tied knots from single pieces of string. Hour after hour, I toiled away, confined rigidly in my single-strand fundamentalism—as my designs grew larger and more complex, I grew increasingly frustrated with my self-imposed limitations, but still I refused to break the mold, ridiculously clinging to the conviction that multi-strand knots were in some sense filthy, impure, and unworthy of my time and effort. <br><br> How wrong I was! This view hinged on the misconception that an extra strand would add nothing to a design beyond the vile promiscuity of extra running ends. This changed, however, when I arrived at the long-overdue realization that each new strand, if worked into the design <i>intelligently and carefully</i>, in fact had the potential to add an entire new axis of symmetry. And suddenly, the multi-strand technique was transformed in my mind from a form of cheap, loathsome harlotry to a noble, pure, and necessary form of abstraction. Making sense? No? That's ok—I wouldn't expect a mind as feeble as yours, dear nonexistent reader, to follow <s>my drunken, late-night/early morning ramblings</s><i>the fabulous intricacies of my imposing genius.</I></p>
